  "description": "This project is a backend service for a weather application designed to provide weather data and forecasts to clients. It utilizes Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API that handles requests for current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical weather data. The application integrates with external weather APIs to fetch data, and MongoDB (via Mongoose) is used for storing any additional data required by the application, such as user preferences or historical weather records. The backend is designed to be scalable and efficient, ensuring quick responses and reliable data delivery.",
